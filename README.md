# PERTPratice

PERTPractice is an educational app that is geared toward clients who are looking to study for the math portion of the PERT test. 

A brief description of the PERT test is as follows: 

“The Postsecondary Education Readiness Test (P.E.R.T.) is Florida's customized common placement test. The purpose of the P.E.R.T. is to determine accurate course placement based on the student's skills and abilities. The P.E.R.T. is aligned with the Postsecondary Readiness Competencies identified by Florida faculty as necessary for success in entry-level college credit coursework. The P.E.R.T. assessment system includes Placement and Diagnostic tests in mathematics, reading and writing.”

## Objective
The problem I will solve is to give my clients the extra practice they need to get a passing score on the test from their phone or tablet. A passing score is 114 for entering college students or 97 for current high school students who are trying to meet the state of Florida Department of Education’s college readiness criteria.

The app’s main focus is giving the user a set of practice problems for each section including a practice test to allow the user to study for the math section of the PERT from their phone. 

This project is a massive accumulation of all the concepts I learned throughout my Udacity journey. I tried to apply all the concepts I learned and then some into this personal project.
